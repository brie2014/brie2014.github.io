                        long-term forecasts so he plan in advance and schedule extra help as needed. If there's a big
                        storm coming, he wants all the details, so he can get his herd safe and secure. He also attends
                        as many community functions as he can, if he knows about them in advance, and stays caught
                        up with local news and politics. </td>

                        also likes to discuss the local news with her mother and attend local events with her brothers.
